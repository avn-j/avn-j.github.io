				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p> <p> Car Pirates is a responsive web application built on the React front-end framework with NodeJS as the back-end.  As part of my university capstone project, my team was assigned to build a web application based on a fictitious business idea.  The delivery of the project was based on agile methodology and consisted of a team of 4 members with different roles.  We worked iteratively through one-week sprints. My role on that team was a <b>Full-Stack Developer.</b> </p> <p> The project utilised many different APIs and technologies for implementing key features. The database was ProgreSQL, the user authentication was Firebase, mock payments used Paypal API, and the maps utilised TomTom map API, and Heroku for deployments. </p> <p> For this web application, I designed and developed the entire responsive user interface of the app. My responsibility was also to integrate APIs with the front end and be able to retrieve and manipulate data in the database for getting car locations and storing car information. </p></p>

				<h2>What I Learnt</h2>
				<p> <p> From working on and building this project, I have learned many essential skills of front-end development. This was my first time working within an Agile practices, it taught me how to effectively collobarate with members of a team with different skillsets, and learning how crucial communication can be in a considerably fast-paced and adaptive work environment. </p> <p> From this experience, I have learned many essential skills of front-end web development. This was my first time working with APIs and using a front-end Javascript framework, it was surprising to me how a front-end framework can drastically  improve the speed of development when building a user interface. One of the biggest challenges I faced was consuming third-party APIs and integrating them with the application;  this required extensive reading of online documentation as well as trial and error, but it taught me how APIs work. </p> <p> Responsive design was one of the criteria of this project and using the Bootstrap CSS library made building a mobile-friendly interface so seamless. </p> <p> I also developed my communication skills and gain an understanding of working with Agile practices within a team. It taught me how to collaborate with other team members effectively and how version control can streamline a project within a team. From this project, I have learned the fundamental skills of a web developer both regarding front-end and back-end development. </p> </p>
