				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p> <p>A playlist generator for Spotify users that allows users to search for Spotify artists and customize a generated playlist for them to listen to. Built on the React front-end framework with a NodeJS + Express backend for API calls to the Spotify Web API. </p> <p>The idea of the project was inspired by needing an automated solution for myself when creating lineup playlists based on music festival that I attend, as I worked on the project I had decided to make a general purpose Spotify generator that others could use. I had a group of friends test the application and had decided to do a general release of the app. </p> <p>This has been my most extensive project thus far incorporating both front-end and back-end development skills. This was also my first solo full-stack project. </p> <p>Features of the application: </p> <ul> <li>Allow users to login with their Spotify account to be able to automatically import generated playlists</li> <li>Search within Spotifys library for artists</li> <li>Customization settings for their generated playlist based on length, old vs. new tracks, include top tracks from their artist selection</li> <li>Uses a simple algorithm to retrieve tracks from Spotify and create a playlist based on customization input</li> <li>Responsive design to allow accessbility on all types of devices</li> </ul></p>

				<h2>What I Learnt</h2>
				<p><p>This project has definitely been my most extensive personal project thus far, it really consolidated my current skills with the React framework and learned some new concepts such as utilising Context API and reducers to manage global state without using a library like Redux. Lots of research and reading documentation came about while working on this project and has greatly broadened my front-end development knowledge.</p>  <p>My back-end skills were also developed when creating this project as I had to familarize myself with APIs and write logic to filter out tracks retrieved from Spotify's Web API. This was my first time using Material UI React library to create the user interface and was introduced to new concepts such as styled components and themeing.</p> <p>From a design standpoint, the UI has been carefully designed and developed to create a brand-like design. Utilising the Material UI framework had streamlined the design process and allowed me to create a responsive UI easily. </p> <p>This is the first full-stack project I have deployed and used Vercel to host, this required some learning aswell in regard to setting up a build and release pipeline and aswell has setting up testing and production environment within Vercel. </p></p>
