				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p> <p>Everyday Desserts is an eCommerce website built on purely vanilla PHP with HTML, CSS and some JavaScript. As part of my eBusiness course in my university, the focus on the project was on the design of the website, purely on our ability to sell products on an online platform rather than technical functionality. A waterfall working approach was taken for this project and my role on my team was the <b>Front-End Developer / Designer</b>. </p> <p>The team had to come up with a feasible business idea with products to sell and create an online platform to sell those products. Our team came up with the idea of creating a meal-kit delivery service, similar to HelloFresh, but with desserts rather than meals. The entire project consisting of creating business plans, pitching and presenting our idea, and creating an online platform to sell the products. As the course did not require extensive technical knowledge, a lot of other teams opted to use website builders to create their website but I wanted to take that extra step to practice my development skills and created a website with PHP. </p> <p> I had designed and developed the entire website using vanilla PHP and since it was no requirement for the project, the website had no functionality implemented (user authentication, payment, ordering). I had designed the initial mock-ups using Adobe Photoshop, and presented it to the team. I had utilised Bootstrap for some components of the website also.</p></p>

				<h2>What I Learnt</h2>
				<p><p>While this project did not exactly expand my technical knowledge, it did give me a chance to focus solely on the design of the website rather than functionality. This helped me learn to create something that is easy to use and to navigate from an average consumer perspective. It taught me the essentials of building a user interface based on selling products, and allowing the user/customer to understand what it is we are actually trying to sell. It is designed to bring the customer in, and keep them on the platform looking for more. </p> <p>From a technical standpoint, this did brush up my knowledge on PHP and CSS with the use of a CSS framework, Bootstrap which increased my productivity in development as I could use the framework to my advantage to implement designs on the website with ease, for example, the user of the icons and the difficulty meter in the Menu page. </p></p>
